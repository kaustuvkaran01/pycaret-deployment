# Pycaret Based Insurance Prediction Application

You can check out the application at : **https://pycaret-streamlit-kkaran.herokuapp.com/**

The application is built using Streamlit and Pycaret.

The model in this hosted application predicts the amount incurred by a person in the hospital and the insurance amount thus generated.
**Task :** Create a Machine Learning Pipeline to predict hospital costs and thus the insurance amount for a person given relevant details using Pycaret and host on Streamlit.

## Data

The data has been taken from the inbuilt insurance dataset of pycaret.

## List of all major frameworks/libraries utilized in the application:

1. Pycaret
2. Streamlit
3. Numpy
4. Pandas

## Highlights

1. Preprocessing

   - Since it was a balanced dataset from pycaret, no preprocessing was required.

2. Pipeline
